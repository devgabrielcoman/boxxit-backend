	<h1>Information we collect.</h1>
	<div>

		If you do so, you authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, such as your
		public Facebook profile (consistent with your privacy settings in Facebook), your email address,
		interests, likes, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, current city, photos,
		personal description, friend list, and information about and photos of your Facebook friends who
		might be common Facebook friends with other Boxxit users. You will also be asked to allow
		Boxxit to collect your location information from your device when you download or use the
		Service. In addition, we may collect and store any personal information you provide while using
		our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your
		name, address, email address and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us,
		financial information. You may also provide us registration information, profile activity, IP
		addresses, referral pages, service behavior, and traffic data. If you contact us with a customer
		service or other inquiry, you provide us with the content of that communication. We will not log
		your information or behavior on other third party applications unrelated to Boxxit.

		editing such profile via application. If you completely delete all such information, then your

	<h1>Cookies and use of cookie and similar data.</h1>
	<div>

	<div>
		We embed pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) on web pages, ads, and
		emails. These tiny, invisible graphics are used to access cookies and track user activities (such as
		how many times a page is viewed). We use pixel tags to measure the popularity of our features
		and services. Ad companies also use pixel tags to measure the number of ads displayed and their
		performance (such as how many people clicked on an ad).
	</div>
	<h1>Mobile device IDs.</h1>
	<div>
		If you're using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique identifier
		assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of
		cookies, to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app.
		Unlike cookies, device IDs cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on
		your iPhone. Ad companies also use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app,
		track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more
		relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.
